# Quantum Signal Processing and Nonlinear Fourier Analysis
This repository contains the things I learned and acquired during my acquisition of the relationship between symmetric quantum signal processing (symQSP) and nonlinear Fourier analysis (NLFA).

## Codes
The file symQSP.m is used to transform from a given phase to the associated function $f(x)$.
